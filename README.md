# EEG_explorer

This is an interactive notebook that allows for quick testing of 
different dipole locations using sliders, while looking at the amplitude 
and shape of the resulting EEG signal.

It can be useful for identifying intersting anatomical locations, 
and for comparing the EEG amplitudes from dipoles at different locations in a detailed head model. 

It is based on the detailed head model named the New York head, see https://www.parralab.org/nyhead/
